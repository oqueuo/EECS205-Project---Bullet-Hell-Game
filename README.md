# EECS205-Project---Bullet-Hell-Game

Titlescreen: Press Z to begin the game

How to play:
Move the character using the arrow keys.
Shoot a projectile with SpaceBar. Keep in mind: your bullet will only shoot upwards, and you only get one that is binded to your soul.
If you shoot again before it hits anything, it will teleport back to you. This is so that you cannot just spam "Shoot" to win in 1 second.
Aim for the boss in the middle. The shooters on the sides are just invincible turrets.
There is a healthbar at the top. You must hit the boss with your bullet 16 times to win.!

Do not get hit by neither the red projectiles nor the fires on the ground.
Getting hit will decrease your health by 1. You have 3 lives. Get hit 3 times = GAME OVER!
